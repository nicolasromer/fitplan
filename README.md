# fitplan
pure php fitness app prototype

minimum requirements: PHP 7.1

to run tests: clone the repo and run 'make' in the root.

For this exercise I wanted to take a test driven approach. I created a scaffolding for easily creating test cases by adding input/expected pairs to an array. There is helpful output shown in the console when running tests. 

The problem is pretty complex at first glance. I thought it would be easier if I could reduce the problem space by creating a block of exercises and rests that answered to a few of the criteria. The initial 'bootcamp' phase of the workout has everyone participate in the same exercises at the same times. they are cardio and non-cardio intersperced and people take breaks when they need based on their level. 

I prioritized the cardio rule and the rests rule because they seem like necessary elements of a basic workout. We can add in things like handstands and limited-use gym equipment as bonus features. For now we want to get the most people involved with the least code overhead.
